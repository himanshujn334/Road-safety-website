          <h3>Traffic Laws</h3>       

          <!-- Add your content here -->
          <p>Traffic signal laws vary by country and region. In general, traffic signals are designed to enable smooth traffic flow at intersections, crossroads and zebra crossings. Following traffic signal rules ensures that there are minimal road mishaps.</p><br>

          <p>In India, for example, disobeying any mandatory traffic sign is a crime punishable by law2. The traffic control signals are based on a three-color light system: red, yellow, and green. The red light means stop, while the yellow means to wait or go slow, and the green light means that vehicles are allowed to go ahead.</p><br>
          
          <p>In the United States, drivers should always use their turn signals when making turns or changing lanes. On freeways and highways, slower traffic generally stays in the right-hand lanes while faster drivers stick to the left-hand lanes.</p><br>
          
          <p>Itâ€™s important to follow traffic signal rules for your safety and the safety of others on the road.</p><br>
