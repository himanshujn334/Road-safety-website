# Road-safety-website 
A road safety website typically provides information about road safety issues and measures to improve it. For example, the Indian Road Safety Campaign website provides information about ongoing activities such as slogan writing contests, poster making contests, article writing competitions on road safety etc. It also has a section for taking a road safety pledge for a safer India1. Another example is the World Health Organization website which provides information about road traffic injuries and measures proven to reduce the risk of road traffic injuries and deaths2. Is there anything specific you would like to know?
